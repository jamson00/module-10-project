# Logo Generator

The Logo Generator is a command-line application that allows users to generate SVG logos based on their input. The application prompts the user for text, text color, shape, shape color, and other criteria, and then generates an SVG file that represents the logo based on the provided input.

   node logoGenerator.js
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter the required information for the logo generation, including text, text color, shape, and shape color.
